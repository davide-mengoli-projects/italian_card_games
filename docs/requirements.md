# Requirements

Requirements for **italian_card_games**: a general-purpose engine for classic Italian 40-card games, playable offline against bots and online against other players.

IDs are stable. Tests and pull requests reference them (e.g. `FR-13`). A requirement is complete only when its *Done when* condition holds.

## 1. Scope and actors

- **Actor:** the *player*. There is no admin or spectator role.
- **Identity:** a player joins with a nickname. There are no accounts and no authentication.
- **In scope:** the game engine, at least two games (Matazza, Briscola), rule-based and LLM-based bots, offline and online play, match history and statistics.
- **Stretch:** a logic-programming or constraint-solver bot (Prolog or Z3).
- **Out of scope:** accounts, spectators, expense splitting, real-money features.

## 2. Functional requirements

### 2.1 Engine (game-independent)

| ID | Requirement | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| FR-01 | The engine supports several games through one common `Game` interface. Adding a game does not change the engine core. | A second game (Briscola) is implemented against the same interface with no change to shared code other than extracted abstractions. |
| FR-02 | The engine provides the 40-card Italian deck (suits denari, coppe, spade, bastoni; ranks 1-10) with shuffling driven by an injectable random source. | Tests show 40 distinct cards, and the same seed gives the same order. |
| FR-03 | Each game declares its own player count and team structure. The engine does not assume 4 free-for-all players. | Matazza declares 4 free-for-all; the interface allows other counts and teams. |
| FR-04 | A player (human or bot) is anything that returns a move given a game state. The engine has no special cases for either. | The same match runs with all-human, all-bot and mixed players through one code path. |
| FR-05 | A move is validated against the rules. An illegal move is rejected with an explicit error and the game state is unchanged. | A test per rule shows the illegal move is rejected and the state is identical before and after. |
| FR-06 | The view of the state given to a player contains only what that player may see (their own hand and public information). | A test shows another player's hand is absent from a player's view. |

### 2.2 Matazza

| ID | Requirement | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| FR-07 | A Matazza match has 4 players, free-for-all. At the start of each round the whole deck is shuffled and 10 cards are dealt to each player. | A round starts with four hands of 10 distinct cards and an empty trick. |
| FR-08 | Card strength in a trick, from highest to lowest, is `3 > 2 > 1 > 10 > 9 > 8 > 7 > 6 > 5 > 4`. | A test covers all 10 ranks against each other. |
| FR-09 | The first card of a trick sets its suit. A player holding a card of that suit must play one. A player with none may play any card. | Tests cover: following suit, forced follow, and discarding when void. |
| FR-10 | The trick is won by the highest-strength card of the led suit. The winner collects the 4 cards and leads the next trick. | A test shows an off-suit card never wins, and the winner leads next. |
| FR-11 | The first trick of a round is led by the player after the dealer. The dealer rotates by one seat each round. | A test over several rounds shows the dealer and first leader moving. |
| FR-12 | After 10 tricks the round ends. Each player's round score is exact: ranks 3, 2, 10, 9, 8 are worth 1/3, the 1 is worth 1, ranks 4, 5, 6, 7 are worth 0. Scores use exact fractions, never floats. | The four scores of any round sum to exactly 32/3. |
| FR-13 | Solo win is checked first, every round. If exactly one player scores more than 1.0 and the other three score 1.0 or less, that player wins the game at once and no standing points are awarded. | A test covers the boundary: a score of exactly 1.0 is not "more than 1.0". |
| FR-14 | Standing points when `numLow == 0` (no player under 1.0): the holder of the 8 of spades is excluded; the other three are compared. If the top two are tied, the holder takes both points. Otherwise the holder and the single top scorer take one each. | Worked examples A and B pass as tests. |
| FR-15 | Standing points when `numLow == 1`: if that player holds the 8 of spades, they take both points. Otherwise that player and the holder take one each. | A test per branch. |
| FR-16 | Standing points when `numLow == 2`: those two players take one point each, regardless of who holds the 8 of spades. | Worked example C passes as a test. |
| FR-17 | The case `numLow == 3` is unreachable because the solo-win check always fires first. If reached, the engine raises an error. | A test forces the state and expects the error. |
| FR-18 | The game ends when one player has 12 standing points (that player loses alone), or when two players have each reached 6 standing points (both lose). The check runs every time points are awarded. | Tests cover both conditions, including the two players reaching 6 in different rounds. |
| FR-19 | At the end of a game each player is recorded as having won or lost. Final standing points do not decide the outcome. A solo-win player wins and the other three lose. When the game ends by the 12-point or the two-at-6 rule, the losing players lose and all others win. | A test per end condition checks the outcome for all four players. |

### 2.3 Briscola

| ID | Requirement | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| FR-20 | At least one more game, Briscola, is playable through the same `Game` interface. Its player count and team rules are specified when it is implemented. | Briscola can be played from start to finish offline against bots. |

### 2.4 AI

| ID | Requirement | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| FR-21 | Bots implement a common `AIStrategy` interface and receive the same player view as a human. | Two strategies are interchangeable without engine changes. |
| FR-22 | A rule-based strategy is the baseline. It always returns a legal move. | A test plays many seeded games with four rule-based bots without an illegal move. |
| FR-23 | Offline mode: one human plays against three bots. | A game can be completed from the UI or a CLI with one human and three bots. |
| FR-24 | An LLM-based strategy implements the same interface. If it fails, times out, or returns an illegal move, the game falls back to the rule-based strategy for that move. | A test with a faulty LLM stub shows the fallback keeps the game going. |
| FR-25 | *(Stretch)* A Prolog or constraint-solver strategy implements the same interface. | The strategy plays a full game with legal moves. |

### 2.5 Lobby and online play

| ID | Requirement | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| FR-26 | A player joins by entering a nickname. | A player can reach the lobby with only a nickname. |
| FR-27 | A player can create a lobby and share a code. Others join with that code. | Two clients meet in one lobby using a code. |
| FR-28 | The lobby creator starts the match. Empty seats are filled with bots. | A lobby with one human starts a full 4-player match. |
| FR-29 | All players in a match receive match updates in real time. | An action by one client is seen by the others without refreshing. |
| FR-30 | If a human disconnects during a match, a bot takes over their seat. | A test disconnects a player mid-match and the game continues. |

### 2.6 History and statistics

| ID | Requirement | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| FR-31 | Finished matches are persisted: game type, participants (human or bot), each player's score in every round, and the win or loss of each player. The total standing points of a game are not stored. | A match survives a restart and can be read back, with its round scores and outcomes. |
| FR-32 | A player can retrieve their match history, including the round-by-round scores of each match. | History for a nickname lists their matches in order, each with its round scores. |
| FR-33 | A player can retrieve statistics: matches played, wins and losses, per game type. | Stats match the stored history in a test. |

### 2.7 API and clients

| ID | Requirement | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| FR-34 | The REST API uses versioned routes (`/api/v1/...`) and publishes an OpenAPI specification. | The OpenAPI document is generated and describes every route. |
| FR-35 | Real-time lobby and match updates are delivered over WebSockets. | See FR-29. |
| FR-36 | A web client lets a player play an offline game against three bots. | A full offline game can be played in the browser. |
| FR-37 | The web client lets a player create or join an online lobby and play. | Two browsers can play a match together. |
| FR-38 | The web client shows match history and statistics. | The data from FR-32 and FR-33 is visible in the UI. |

## 3. Non-functional requirements

| ID | Requirement | Done when |
|---|---|---|
| NFR-01 | **Architecture.** The domain core is framework-free (hexagonal). It never imports FastAPI, NiceGUI or SQLAlchemy. Those are adapters behind interfaces. | An automated check or test fails if the core imports a framework. |
| NFR-02 | **Coverage.** Test coverage is at least 70% on the domain core and at least 50% overall. | The CI coverage report meets both thresholds. |
| NFR-03 | **Acceptance tests.** Each functional requirement has at least one test that references its ID. | Each `FR-xx` appears in a test name or docstring. |
| NFR-04 | **Reproducibility.** Given the same seed and the same moves, a game produces the same result. | A test replays a recorded game and matches the final state. |
| NFR-05 | **Portability.** The project runs on Python 3.11 or newer, on Windows, macOS and Linux. | The CI matrix passes on all three systems. |
| NFR-06 | **Responsiveness.** A rule-based bot answers within 1 second. An LLM bot has a timeout of 10 seconds before the fallback (FR-24). | Timeouts are configurable and tested with a stub. |
| NFR-07 | **Delivery.** CI separates checking (lint, types, tests, coverage) from deploy. At least two SemVer releases are published to PyPI or TestPyPI. | Two tagged releases exist and installs work. |
| NFR-08 | **Process.** Commits follow Conventional Commits. Work goes through pull requests into `develop`, with CI passing. | The history and branch protection show this. |
| NFR-09 | **Deployability.** The full stack starts with Docker Compose. | `docker compose up` brings up API and client. |
| NFR-10 | **Documentation.** Decisions are recorded as ADRs, and the license choice is justified. | The ADRs and the license justification exist in the docs. |
